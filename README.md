## How to use it? 

Clone / download this sample project.

* `AUTH0_TENANT`: your tenant name in Auth0 
* `SANDBOX_URL`: sandbox container url - 'https://sandbox.it.auth0.com' for public cloud
* `WEBTASK_TOKEN`: the webtask token. You can get your webtask token from [your auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/account/webtasks).


Example, populated `.env` file:


```
AUTH0_TENANT=arcseldon-tenant
SANDBOX_URL=https://sandbox.it.auth0.com
WEBTASK_TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJdfdfIsImtpZCI6InVzLTMifQ.eyJqdGkiOiJhOTNlMjU1NzgyYmadsfdfGZmOWU5YTE2YjNkYzFlOCIsImlhdCI6MTQ4Nzc0OTU1NywiY2EiOltdLCJkZCI6MSwidGVuIjoiYWdsLWZsb3dzIn0.wi7c3Qn1x1K3upA2dfdfdLhUUkSbQ9EfH-u_M-RR5Ze4

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## Create a free Auth0 Account
